Universe Database Explanation
Overview
The Universe Database is designed to store information about various celestial objects, including galaxies, stars, planets, moons, and comets.
This database organizes astronomical data in a structured manner, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of information.

Database Creation Steps
Logging into PostgreSQL
To begin, log into PostgreSQL using the provided credentials. This establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL server where the database will be created.

Creating the Database
Create a new database named universe. This database serves as the main container for all the tables and data related to celestial objects.

Connecting to the Database
After creating the universe database, connect to it to start creating the necessary tables.

Creating Tables
Galaxy Table

The galaxy table stores information about different galaxies, including their name, description, type, distance from Earth, and whether they have life. Each galaxy
has a unique identifier (galaxy_id) that auto-increments.
Star Table

The star table stores information about stars, including their name, the galaxy they belong to, type, age in millions of years, and brightness. Each star has a unique
identifier (star_id) that auto-increments. The table references the galaxy table through a foreign key (galaxy_id).
Planet Table

The planet table stores information about planets, including their name, the star they orbit, whether they are spherical, distance from their star, and whether they have
life. Each planet has a unique identifier (planet_id) that auto-increments. The table references the star table through a foreign key (star_id).
Moon Table

The moon table stores information about moons, including their name, the planet they orbit, whether they are round, and their age in millions of years. Each moon has a unique
identifier (moon_id) that auto-increments. The table references the planet table through a foreign key (planet_id).
Comet Table

The comet table stores information about comets, including their name, description, whether they are periodic, orbit duration, and who observed them. Each comet has a unique
identifier (comet_id) that auto-increments.
Inserting Data
Inserting Data into Galaxy Table

Insert at least six rows into the galaxy table, providing information about various galaxies.
Inserting Data into Star Table

Insert at least six rows into the star table, providing information about different stars and their associated galaxies.
Inserting Data into Planet Table

Insert at least twelve rows into the planet table, providing information about different planets and their associated stars.
Inserting Data into Moon Table

Insert at least twenty rows into the moon table, providing information about various moons and their associated planets.
Inserting Data into Comet Table

Insert data into the comet table, providing information about various comets.
Summary
The Universe Database consists of five main tables: galaxy, star, planet, moon, and comet. Each table has a primary key that auto-increments and includes necessary columns to store
detailed information about each celestial object. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity and enabling complex queries across different
types of celestial objects. This structured approach allows for efficient data management and retrieval in astronomical research and applications.
